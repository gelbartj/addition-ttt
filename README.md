# Math Four-in-a-Row

This is the source code repository for the Math Four-in-a-Row game, which is currently hosted on AWS Amplify at https://with-backend.d137sqorxi6sri.amplifyapp.com/. The game comes from the [Mindset Mathematics](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Mathematics-Visualizing-Investigating-Ideas/dp/1119358833) book by Stanford Professor Jo Boaler. I was not able to find an online version of the game anywhere, so I decided to build one myself! No copyright infringement is intended here, as I am a big fan of Professor Boaler and this is not a commercial project.

This project is very much in beta, however I hope some math educators out there find it useful. Students can either play against each other while sitting at the same computer, or on different computers by using join codes similar to Kahoot. The latter functionality is implemented using the AWS Amplify GraphQL API.
